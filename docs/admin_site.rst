Admin Site
============

Once installed, you should see a `Permissions Auditor` category in your Django admin panel.

    All staff members will be able to access the site views index.


Site Views
----------

Your registered site views should display with the permissions required and any additional information
in the table.

.. note::
    If you see unexpected results, or missing permissions, ensure your :ref:`processors` are correctly
    configured. You may need to create a custom processor if you have a view that does not use
    the built-in Django auth mixins / decorators.


When you click on a permission, you will be taken to a page which will allow you to manage
what users and groups have that permission.


Permissions Management Page
---------------------------

Detected permissions will be automatically hyperlinked to a configuration page where you can modify
what groups and users have the permission.

.. note::
    In order to modify permissions on this page, the user must have the ``auth.change_user`` and
    ``auth.change_group`` permissions.


Groups Management Page
----------------------

The default Django groups page does not let you quickly see what permissions are assigned to groups
without viewing each group individually.

Django-permissions-auditor implements a groups list containing the assigned permissions and active
users.
